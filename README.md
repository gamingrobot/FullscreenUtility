# FullscreenUtility
Tool for QoL improvements for borderless fullscreen games

This was created because I wanted to play a borderless windowed/fullscreen game and keep my cursor bound to the primary monitor and allow me to watch stuff on Firefox's Picture-in-Picture mode without accidently clicking and moving the window.

## Features

- Keeps cursor bound to a borderless fullscreen game
- Sets Firefox's Picture-in-Picture window to mouse click-through when the cursor is bound to the fullscreen game
